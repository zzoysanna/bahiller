# ass

A task, often bureaucratic, that is more difficult than it needs to be.
Now I need three forms of ID and a copy of my electric bill just to renew my driver's license? What a pain in the ass!

My headlight fuse burned out. Changing it was a real pain in the ass because I had to take apart half the dashboard to get to the fuse panel.
